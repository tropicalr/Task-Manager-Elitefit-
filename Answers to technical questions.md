1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
   - I spent a total of 6 to 7 hours in this coding. I spent 2 hours into assessing what all the are the project needs, rquirements and components that would go into the web page. I spent the rest of the 4 hours into programming and bringing everything to life to the best of my capacity.
      
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
   - The most useful feature in my opinion is the introduction of React Hooks in the React 16.8 version. I am using using React Hooks in the TaskList.js file. I used the "useState" Hook. Here it manages the state variables line like tasks, search, priorityFilter, completionFilter in functional components, replacing the need for class-based state.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
   - Some of the few ways on how I would track down a performance issue is follows.
     A. Implement monitoring tools like Google Analytics to track performance metrics and errors.
     B. Add logging to critical parts of the application like task loading, filtering etc.
     C. Implement changes locally and test thoroughly.
     D. Deploy changes incrementally and monitor their impact using your monitoring tools.
     E. Utilize DevTools to profile the application.
     F. Review and optimize slow components.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
   A. If I had more time for this task, one aspect that I would have liked to implement is security in this case, Authorization and user authentication. I would have used Firebase or Auth0 to allow only users with access and authorization are allowed to leverage the functionalities of the application.
   B.I would also try to add an analytics dashboard to provide insights on task completion rates, overdue tasks, and user productivity trends.
   C.Lastly, I would try to integrate a drag-and-drop interface to allow users to easily reorder tasks and move them between sections.
