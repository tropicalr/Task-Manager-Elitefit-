# Task-Manager-Elitefit-
1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
   - I spent a total of 6 to 7 hours in this coding. I spent 2 hours into assessing what all the are the project needs, rquirements and components that would go into the web page. I spent the rest of the 4 hours into programming and bringing everything to life to the best of my capacity.
      
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
   - The most useful feature in my opinion is the introduction of React Hooks in the React 16.8 version. I am using using React Hooks in the TaskList.js file. I used the "useState" Hook. Here it manages the state variables line like tasks, search, priorityFilter, completionFilter in functional components, replacing the need for class-based state.

  How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
